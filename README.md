Pharma Supply Chain System Using Smart Contracts
This project demonstrates a blockchain-based solution to enhance the security, transparency, and efficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain using smart contracts. The system helps prevent fraud, counterfeiting, and other illegal activities by creating an immutable record of every transaction in the supply chain.

Features:
Immutable Record: Ensures that all transactions in the supply chain are recorded on the blockchain, making them tamper-proof.
Supply Chain Stages: Tracks the movement of pharmaceutical products through various stages such as Manufactured, Distributed, InPharmacy, and Sold.
Enhanced Security: Prevents data breaches, hacking, and other security threats by leveraging blockchain technology.

Technologies Used:
Solidity: Smart contract development language used to write the supply chain logic.
Ethereum: Blockchain platform for deploying the smart contract.
Remix IDE: An online tool for compiling, testing, and deploying the smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain.
